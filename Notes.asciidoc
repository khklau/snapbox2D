= Data Structures

== BlockHeader

* handle to a heap block allocation requested by Box2D

* header and block are allocated together contiguously

* BlockHeaders are chained together in a double linked list

== StoredBlock

* handle to saved blocks copies or saved block diffs

* contains fields for block size, data size and some helper fields for delta compression

* contains a pointer to its BlockHeader

* StoredBlocks are chained together in a single linked list

== Sim

* free_list - an unordered_map of allocation sizes to linked list of BlockHeaders; this represents the free list of blocks

* last_block - pointer to a double linked list of BlockHeaders taken

* stateful allocator

== SimMem

* handle to absolute or relative StoredBlocks

* first_block - pointer to a double linked list of StoredBlock

* rel - a pointer to another SimMem which is used if the StoredBlock is a diff

= Operations

== Sim::b2Alloc

# if the free list has an available block of the requested size use it otherwise allocate a new header and block

# zeroes the block

# adds the BlockHeader to the last_block linked list

== Sim::b2free

# if the given block is last_block, update last_block to point to the previous block

# remove the block from the taken double linked list

# insert the block into free_list

== Sim::save

# If a rel_mem argument was given

## construct an unordered_map of BlockHeader pointers to const StoredBlock pointers by following the StoredBlock list
   in rel_mem (does not follow through rel_mem.rel though!)

## set rel_mem as the rel field for the into SimMem argument

# Frees any existing StoredBlock list in the into SimMem argument

# Iterates through the Sim's BlockHeader list and

## checks whether that BlockHeader exists in the unordered_map constructed earlier

## constructs a new compressed relative StoredBlock if the BlockHeader was found otherwise an absolute new StoredBlock (memcpy of BlockHeader's block)

## adds the new StoredBlock to the into SimMem argument's list

= Data Structures

== BlockHeader

* handle to a heap block allocation requested by Box2D

* header and block are allocated together contiguously

* BlockHeaders are chained together in a double linked list

== StoredBlock

* handle to saved heap blocks

* contains fields for block size, data size and some helper fields for delta compression

* contains a pointer to its BlockHeader

* contains a pointer to the next StorageBlock (unnecessary IMHO)

== Sim

* free_list - an unordered_map of allocation sizes to linked list of BlockHeaders; this represents the free list of blocks

* last_block - pointer to a double linked list of BlockHeaders in use

= Operations

== Sim::b2Alloc

# if the free list has an available block of the requested size use it otherwise allocate a new header and block

# zeroes the block

# adds the BlockHeader to the last_block linked list
